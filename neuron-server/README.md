# Use of Neuron server
Run ```server.py``` on your home PC or laptop to start server at localhost:8000. The device running the code must be reasonably powerful for the robot to work, as the latency of predictons relies solely on how powerful the server device is.
The Neuron autonomous drive code connects to and uses the server. The address for the server is hardcoded in that file, so be sure to change it.

The model file is currently not present here, so once training is done, be sure to copy it into the server directory.
