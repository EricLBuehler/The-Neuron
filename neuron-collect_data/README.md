# Collect Data
Run the ```collect_data.py``` program to collect data. 
It can be used with a remote viewing software to allow the driver to control the robot from a secondary computer.

This program is desinged to stop collecting data once the appropriate amount is collected (3200 datapoints). Assuming one is collecting on average 1 datapoint every 3 seconds, it should take around 2.5 hours of driving to collect the entire amount of data.
