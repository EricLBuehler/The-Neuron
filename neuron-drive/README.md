# Neuron Driving

This software provides a way to use the robot as a "plain" robot. It allows the user to drive the robot remotely, and shows RGB and depth video feeds on screen for control. 
In order to use this software, run ```drive.py```. This will allow the user to begin driving the robot remotely.

To drive, use the ```w``` ```a``` ```s``` ```d``` keys for directional control, and the digits 1-9 for speed control. The space is a stop that is logged in the data collection system, and the key ```e``` triggers a stop that is not logged.

Note: When connecting to a remote viewing software such as VNC, be sure to boot the Raspberry Pi while it is connected to HDMI. This will cause the Raspberry Pi to use the full screen.
