# Neuron Driving

This software provides a way to use the robot as a "plain" robot. It allows the user to drive the robot remotely, and shows RGB and depth video feeds on screen for control. 
In order to use this software, be sure to copy this folder into a good location. Then, run ```drive.py```. This will allow the user to drive the robot remotely.
Note: When connecting to a remote viewing software such as VNC, be sure to boot the Raspberry Pi while it is connected to HDMI. This will cause the Raspberry Pi to use the full screen.
