# Neuron AI

## AI architecture
### Overview
The Neuron utilizes a PerceiverIO model for autonomous driving. The model is built using PyTorch, and is effectively a classifier.

### Architecture
The AI used in this application is based on a PerceiverIO. However, several multilayer perceptrons are built in to the model for things such as query generation and tensor dimension mapping. The PerceiverIO input dimension is 512, and the logits dimension is 5. The model's depth is 12, and has a ```latent_dim``` of 784, and a ```num_latents``` of 512. The PerceiverIO also has the decoder feed-forward enabled.

### Query generation
I use a multilayer perceptron to generate queries. The query generator scales the input dimension of the model (512) up to 1024, and then down to the query dimension (256). The query generator takes the PerceiverIO input as the input, and the output is directly used as the query for the PerceiverIO.

## Training

### Model training process

Before training, ensure that the ```prefix``` variable is set to the correct working directory, which must also include the dataset.
The ```modelname``` variable should also be set to your desired value.
This code is designed to be run on Google Colab. If you are using a CPU instance, be sure to set the ```CPUonly``` to True.
If you are using a GPU instance, ```CPUonly``` should be False.

### Dataset

The dataset used to train this model should be found in the ```prefix``` directory, and should be generated by the Neuron data collection program.
The dataset directory needs to contain the CSV file for data loading, as well as a sub directory ```images```, which contains the depth camera images.

### Training results

The train program will output a final model in PyTorch ```.pth``` format, as well loss and accuracy logs.

## Visualizing results
Before visualizing results, ensure that the ```prefix``` variable is set to the correct working directory, and that the variable ```modelname``` corresponds to the correct model.
