## Training models

### Model training process

Before training, ensure that the ```prefix``` variable is set to the working directory, which must also include the dataset.
This code is designed to be run on Google Colab. If you are using a CPU instance, be sure to set the ```CPUonly``` to True.
If you are using a GPU instance, ```CPUonly``` should be False.

### Dataset

The dataset used to train this model should be found in the ```prefix``` directory, and should be generated by the Neuron data collection program.
The dataset directory needs to contain the CSV file for data loading, as well as a sub directory ```images```, which contains the depth camera images.
