# Training models and visualizing reuslts

## Training models

### Model training process

Before training, ensure that the ```prefix``` variable is set to the correct working directory, which must also include the dataset.
The ```modelname``` variable should also be set to your desired value.
This code is designed to be run on Google Colab. If you are using a CPU instance, be sure to set the ```CPUonly``` to True.
If you are using a GPU instance, ```CPUonly``` should be False.

### Dataset

The dataset used to train this model should be found in the ```prefix``` directory, and should be generated by the Neuron data collection program.
The dataset directory needs to contain the CSV file for data loading, as well as a sub directory ```images```, which contains the depth camera images.

### Result outputs

The train program will output a final model in PyTorch ```.pth``` format, as well loss and accuracy logs.

## Visualizing results
Before visualizing results, ensure that the ```prefix``` variable is set to the correct working directory, and that the variable ```modelname``` corresponds to the correct model.
