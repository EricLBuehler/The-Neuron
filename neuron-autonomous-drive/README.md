# Autonomous driving

**To begin autonomous driving:**
1. Start the webserver on a machine of your choice.
2. Run ```drive.py``` to start driving.

Status can be monitored on the webserver home page. This program is also designed to be viewed remotely, as a depth and RGB video feed are both present.

**Note**: Webserver will be at the ```localhost:8000``` address of the machine hosting it. If the hosting machine's IP address is 192.168.1.3, then the webserver address will
be 192.168.1.3:8000. Ensure that the hardcoded IP address in variable ```ip```, in ```drive.py```, is set to the correct value.
